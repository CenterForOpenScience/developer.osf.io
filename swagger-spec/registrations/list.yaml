  summary: List all registrations
  description: >-
    A paginated list of registrations on the OSF to which the user has access.


    The returned registrations are those which are public or which the user has access to view.


    Non-registered nodes cannot be accessed through this endpoint (use the [nodes](#Nodes_nodes_list) endpoints instead).


    #### Registrations


    A registration on the OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted.
    The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.


    Registrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.


    #### Withdrawals


    Registrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn.
    Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata.
    A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement.
    All other fields will be displayed as null.
    Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors.
    All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.


    #### Returns


    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations.
    Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used
    for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


    This request should never return an error.


    #### Filtering


    You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/?filter[title]=open.


    Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.


    You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).
