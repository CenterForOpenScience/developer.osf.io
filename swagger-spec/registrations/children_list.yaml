# /registrations/{registration_id}/children/
get:
  summary: List all child registrations
  description: >-

    A paginated list of children of a registration.


    The list consists of the next level child registrations for the given registration.
    The returned registrations are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated child registrations appearing first.


    The list will include child registrations that are public, as well as child registrations that are private, if the authenticated user has permission to view them.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 child registrations.
    If the given registration has zero child registrations, the `data` key will contain an empty array.
    Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the child registration.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).


    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/children/?filter[title]=reproducibility.


    Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.


    Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.
    Public is a boolean field, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**.
    Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.

                    been collected for T2 (when menstrual cycle information will be assessed).
                    Therefore, data cannot be analysed at the time of preregistration.
