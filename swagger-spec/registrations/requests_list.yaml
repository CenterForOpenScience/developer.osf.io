  description: >-
    Retrieve a list of requests associated with a specific registration.

    Requests allow contributors and moderators to manage changes to a registration,
    including withdrawal requests, embargo requests, and schema update requests.
    
    #### Permissions
     - Public registrations expose some request metadata publicly.
     - Private registrations require read access for non-admin contributors.
     - Only admins and moderators can view and manage sensitive request details.

    #### Returns
     - A JSON object with a `data` key containing an array of request records.
     - Each request includes the type of request (withdrawal, embargo, etc.), its state,
      and information about who initiated the request.
