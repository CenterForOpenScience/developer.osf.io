  summary: Retrieve Linked Nodes Relationship for a Registration or Node
  description: >-
    Retrieve the relationship data for linked nodes associated with a specific registration or node.

    Linked nodes are nodes that have been explicitly linked to the current registration/node through the `linked_nodes` relationship.

    This endpoint returns an array of linked node resource identifier objects (`id` and `type`).  
    To retrieve detailed information about each linked node, you should query the `/linked_nodes/` endpoint  
    or follow the `related` link provided in this response.

    #### Permissions
    - Public nodes/registrations expose linked nodes publicly.
    - Private nodes/registrations require appropriate permissions to view their linked nodes.

    #### Returns
    - A JSON object with a `data` key, containing an array of `nodes` resource identifier objects (`id` and `type`).
