  summary: List Schema Responses for a Registration
  description: >-
    Retrieve a list of all Schema Responses associated with a specific registration.

    Schema Responses represent the answers provided to a registration schema's questions. They reflect the current and historical state of responses submitted for the registration.

    A registration can have multiple schema responses over time due to edits or updates, depending on the registration provider's workflow.

    #### Permissions
     - Publicly accessible for public registrations.
     - Private registrations require appropriate permissions (must be a contributor with read access).

    #### Returns
     - A JSON object with a `data` key containing an array of schema response resources.
     - Each schema response includes its current state, related actions, and the data provided in the registration form.
