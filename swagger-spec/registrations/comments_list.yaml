# /registrations/{registration_id}/comments/
get:
  summary: List all comments
  description: >-

    A paginated list of the registration's comments.


    The returned comments are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent
    comments appearing first.

    ####Permissions

    Comments of public registrations are given read-only access to everyone.


    If the comment-level is `private`, only registration contributors have permission to comment.


    If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.


    Comments of private registrations are only visible to contributors and administrators on the registration.

    ####Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of comment objects.
    Each resource in the array is a separate comment object.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include comments that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wuerf/comments/?filter[target]=wuerf


    Comments may be filtered by their `deleted`, `target`, `date_created`, `date_modified`.


    Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.
    Deleted is a boolean field, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**.
    Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail.

                We have published a Bayesian reanalysis of this project at PLOS ONE: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0149794

                I explain some of the context on my blog: http://alexanderetz.com/2016/02/26/the-bayesian-rpp-take-2/

                Please note that the analysis we use in this paper is very different from the analysis used in the blog I posted in the previous comment, so the results are different as well.

              content: In this blog http://wp.me/p4sgtg-o6 I conduct a Bayesian Re-analysis
                of the Reproducibility Project that gives a graded measure of replication success.
                In an attempt to avoid dichotomous success/fail replication outcomes, I calculate
                a continous outcome (Bayes factor) that answers the question, does the replication
                result fit more with the original reported effect or a null effect? Many replications
                are strong successes, many are strong failures, and there are many that lie
                somewhere in between.
