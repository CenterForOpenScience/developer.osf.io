  summary: List all forks
  description: >-

    A paginated list of the registration’s forks


    The returned forks are sorted by their `forked_date`, with the most recent forks appearing first.


    Forking a registration creates a copy of an existing registration and all of its contents.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 forks.
    If the current registration has no fork, the `data` key will contain an empty array.
    Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration's fork.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

  summary: Create a fork
  description: >-
    Creates a fork of the given registration.


    Forking a project creates a copy of an existing registration and all of its contents.
    The fork always points back to the original registration, forming a network of registrations.


    You might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend.
    For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use.
    Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.


    When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current registration and components for which you are a contributor.
    Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.

    #### Required

    There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked registration's attributes will be copied from the current registration.


    The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current registration's title.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete representation of the forked registration, if the request is successful.

    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
