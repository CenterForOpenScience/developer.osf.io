  summary: Retrieve a registration
  description: >-
    Retrieve the details of a given registration.


    #### Permissions


    Only project contributors may retrieve the details of a registration that is embargoed, or has not yet been made public.
    Attempting to retrieve a private registration for which you are not a contributor will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.


    Authentication is not required to view the details of a public registration, as public registrations give read-only access to everyone.


    #### Registrations


    A registration on the OSF creates a frozen, time-stamped version of a project that cannot be edited or deleted.


    The *original project* can still be edited, while the registered version cannot.


    Registrations can be made public immediately or embargoed for up to 4 years.


    #### Withdrawals


    Registrations cannot be deleted, but they can be withdrawn.
    Withdrawing a registration removes the content of the registration but leaves behind basic metadata.
    A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information, namely, title, description, date_created, date_registered, date_withdrawn, registration, withdrawn, withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement.
    All other fields will be displayed as null.
    Additionally, the only relationship that remains accesible for a withdrawn registration is the contributors.
    All other relationships will return a **403 Forbidden** response.


    #### Returns


    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested
    registration, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.

patch:
  summary: Update a registration
  description: >-
    Registrations can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request.
    There are a handful of fields that can be edited by registration administrators,
    and a few fields by users with write permissions.

    Note - one of the fields you can edit is `public`. Registrations can only be turned
    from private to public, not vice versa.

    #### Permissions

    Only project administrators may update a registration (with a few exceptions). For example,
    write contributors can edit tags.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated
    registration, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.
