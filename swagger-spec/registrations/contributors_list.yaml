#/registrations/{registration_id}/contributors/
get:
  summary: List all contributors
  description: >-
    A paginated list of all contributors on this registration.

    The returned contributors are sorted by their index.


    Contributors are users who can make changes to the registration or, in the case of private registration, have read access to the registration.


    Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic".
    From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed in the contributors list on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.


    Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.


    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 contributors.
    Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor.
    Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wu3a4/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.


    Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.
