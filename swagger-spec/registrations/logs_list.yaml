# /registrations/{registration_id}/logs
get:
  summary: List all logs
  description: >-
    A paginated list of the registration's logs.


    The returned logs are sorted by their `date`, with the most recents logs appearing
    first.


    ####Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 logs.
    Each resource in the array is a separate logs object.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

    ####Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include logs that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/registrations/wucr8/logs/?filter[action]=made_private.


    Logs may be filtered by their `action`, and `date`.
