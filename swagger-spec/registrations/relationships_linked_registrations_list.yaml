  summary: Retrieve Linked Registrations Relationship for a Registration
  description: >-
    Retrieve the relationship data for linked registrations associated with a specific registration.

    Linked registrations are registrations that have been explicitly linked to the given registration through the `linked_registrations` relationship.

    This endpoint returns an array of linked registration resource identifier objects (`id` and `type`).  
    To retrieve detailed information about each linked registration, you should query the `/registrations/{registration_id}/linked_registrations/` endpoint  
    or follow the `related` link provided in this response.

    #### Permissions
    - Public registrations expose linked registrations publicly.
    - Private registrations require appropriate permissions to view their linked registrations.

    #### Returns
    - A JSON object with a `data` key, containing an array of `registration` resource identifier objects (`id` and `type`).
