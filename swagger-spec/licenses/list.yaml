get:
  summary: List all licenses
  description: >-
    A paginated list of licenses.
    The returned licenses are sorted by their name.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

    The `data` key contains an array of 10 licenses.
    Each resource in the array is a separate license object and contains the full representation
    of the license, meaning additional requests to a license's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used
    for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


    This request should never return an error.

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include licenses that
    match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    [https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/?filter[name]=apache](https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/?filter[name]=apache).


    Licenses may be filtered by their `id`, and `name`.
