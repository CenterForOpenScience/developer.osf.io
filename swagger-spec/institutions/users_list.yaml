  summary: List all affiliated users
  description: >-
    A paginated list of all users affiliated with an institution.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 users.
    Each resource in the array is a separate users object.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used
    for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include users that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/institutions/cos/users?filter[family_name]=Nosek.


    Users may be filtered by their `id`, `full_name`, `given_name`, `middle_names`, and `family_name`


    You can learn more about advanced filtering features [here](#tag/Filtering).
