  summary: Create a Preprint Request Action
  description: >-
    Create a new action on a Preprint Request.

    Preprint Request Actions record transitions and comments during moderation workflows
    on preprint-related requests, such as access changes or withdrawal approvals.

    #### Available Triggers

    Supported `trigger` values:
     - `submit`: Submit or re-submit the request for review.
     - `accept`: Approve the request (e.g., accept withdrawal).
     - `reject`: Reject the request.
     - `edit_comment`: Add or update a comment without affecting state.

    #### Permissions

     - `submit`: Allowed for users with write access on the preprint.
     - `accept`, `reject`, `edit_comment`: Require admin privileges or moderator rights via provider.

    #### Returns

    On success, returns `201 Created` with a full representation of the new action.

    #### Errors

     - `400 Bad Request`: Malformed or missing fields in the request body.
     - `403 Forbidden`: Action not permitted for the current user.
     - `409 Conflict`: Invalid transition for the request's current state.

    For full error handling, see [Errors and Error Codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes).
