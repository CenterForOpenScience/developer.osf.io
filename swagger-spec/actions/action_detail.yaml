  summary: Retrieve an Action by ID
  description: >-
    Retrieve detailed information about a specific Action using its unique identifier.

    Actions record state transitions, user comments, and workflow triggers related to resources like preprints, registrations, node requests, schema responses, and collection submissions.

    An Action includes:
      - The initiating event (`trigger`)
      - Optional user-provided comments (`comment`)
      - Resource state before (`from_state`) and after (`to_state`) the action
      - Metadata such as timestamps (`date_created`, `date_modified`) and visibility settings (`visible`)
      - Relationships linking the action to its creator, target resource, and the provider managing the process.

    #### Permissions

     - Users must have at least read permissions on the associated resource.
     - Non-public actions (`visible: false`) require administrative or moderator privileges.

    #### Errors

    An unsuccessful request returns an `errors` key. Refer to the [Errors and Error Codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) documentation.
