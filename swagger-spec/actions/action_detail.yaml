  summary: Retrieve an Action by ID
  description: >-
    Retrieve the details of a specific Action by its unique identifier.

    Actions represent state transitions and comments on reviewable resources
    such as preprints, registrations, node requests, schema responses, and
    collection submissions.

    An Action includes information about who performed the action (creator),
    the state change it caused (from_state to to_state), the trigger used to initiate
    the action, and any optional comment. The action may also include links to
    related resources, such as the target and the provider.

    #### Returns

    A JSON object with a `data` key containing the full representation of the action.

    #### Permissions

    - You must have at least read permissions on the resource the action applies to.
    - Only authorized users can view non-public actions (`visible: false`).

    #### Errors

    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key will be returned. Refer to the
    [Errors and Error Codes documentation](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) for more information.
