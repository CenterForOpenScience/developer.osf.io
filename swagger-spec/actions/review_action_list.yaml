  summary: List Review Actions
  description: >-
    Retrieve a list of review actions accessible to the authenticated user. Review actions document state transitions or user comments related specifically to reviewable resources, like preprints.

    Supports pagination and filtering by:
      - `id`
      - `trigger`
      - `from_state`
      - `to_state`
      - `date_created`
      - `date_modified`

    Pagination follows the [JSON:API pagination specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).

    #### Permissions

     - User must be authenticated and have permissions to view actions associated with the respective resources.

    #### Errors

    If unsuccessful, returns an `errors` object. See [Errors and Error Codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes).
