    description: >-
      Welcome to the Open Science Framework API. With this API you can access
      users, projects, components, logs, and files from the [Open Science
      Framework](https://osf.io/). The Open Science Framework (OSF) is a free,
      open-source service maintained by the [Center for Open
      Science](http://cos.io/).


      The OSF serves as a repository and archive for study designs, materials,
      data, manuscripts, or anything else associated with your research during
      the research process. Every project and file on the OSF has a permanent
      unique identifier, and every registration (a permanent, time-stamped
      version of your projects and files) can be assigned a DOI. You can
      use the OSF to measure your impact by monitoring the traffic to projects
      and files you make public. With the OSF you have full control of what
      parts of your research are public and what remains private.

  - name: General Usage
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      The OSF API generally conforms to the [JSON-API v1.0 spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/).
      Where exceptions exist, they will be noted. Each endpoint will have its own documentation, but
      there are some general principles.

      Note: Assume undocumented routes/features/fields are unstable.

      #### Canonical URLs

      All canonical URLs have trailing slashes.  A request to an endpoint
      without a trailing slash will result in a **301 Redirect** to the canonical
      URL.  There are some exceptions when working with the Files API, so if a
      URL in a response does not have a slash, do not append one.

      #### Plurals

      Endpoints are always pluralized.  `/users/`, not `/user/`, `/nodes/`,
      not `/node/`.

      The only exception are the node and preprint citation endpoints, which are `/citation/`, not
      `/citations/`.

      #### Common Actions

      Every endpoint in the OSF API responds to `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTION` requests.

      You must have adequate permissions to interact with any endpoint.
      Unauthorized use will result in **401 Unauthorized** or **403 Forbidden** responses.

      Use `HEAD` to probe an endpoint and make sure your headers are well-formed.
      A `GET` request will return a representation of the entity or entity collection referenced by the endpoint.

      An `OPTIONS` request will return a JSON object that describes the endpoint, including the name, a description,
      the acceptable request formats, the allowed response formats, and any actions available via the endpoint.

      ### Testing

      The OSF provides public testing servers to test integrations against.

      #### Testing Server

      The test-* subdomains of the OSF are intended to match, at any given time, the current production environment of the Open Science Framework.

      We have staging servers that will have newer features, including newer API features, that aren't ready for production.
      However, because those servers are subject to the whims of QA and whichever group needs to do specific testing, they aren't particular stable for API developers.
      #### Testing Server

      The `test` subdomains of the OSF are intended to match, at any given time, the current production environment of the OSF.
      The test servers linked below are primarily for developing your API application on a stable system.

      - Test web server: https://test.osf.io/

      - Test API server: https://api.test.osf.io/v2/

      - Test Files server (known as Waterbutler): https://files.us.test.osf.io/

      #### Ephemerality Notice

      Expect the server to be down from time to time while we update software, and don't expect data to persist indefinitely.
      We periodically run data migrations on the test servers without notice.

  - name: Authentication
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      #### Token Auth

      To use a Personal Access Token, make an `Authorization` header with the contents `Bearer <token>` as shown in the example below, replacing `<token>` with your token.

          curl -X "GET" "https://api.osf.io/v2/users/me/" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

      To make a Personal Access Token, visit your OSF settings page (either on the [OSF](https://osf.io/settings/tokens) or our [testing server](https://test.osf.io/settings/tokens)) to create one.
      You can limit the scope of the token, but remember that it has access to all of the information that you do within the limits of the scope, so be careful with your tokens.

      #### OAuth

      The OSF allows third-party web applications to connect to the OSF on behalf of other users via the OAuth 2.0 web application flow.

      You can add a developer application from the OSF settings page (either on the [OSF](https://osf.io/settings/applications) or our [testing server](https://test.osf.io/settings/applications)).


      We will be adding narrative documentation for handling OAuth flows, but for now, if you're familiar with OAuth, you can check out the [OAuth SSO Guide](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/osf-cas/blob/develop/README_OAUTH_SSO_GUIDE.md) for options.

  - name: Pagination
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      All entity collection endpoints respond to the `page` query parameter as described in the [JSON-API spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).


      However, links to the first, last, previous, and next pages of results are provided in the `links` key of the response,
      and you are encouraged to use those rather than adding query parameters by hand.


      If there are only enough results to fill one page, the `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` links will be null.

      #### Versioning

      As of version `2.3`, pagination links conform to the JSON API specification.
      Meta information was pulled out of the `links` object and placed in a top-level `meta` object.


      The `meta` key contains the total number of entities available, as well as the current number of results displayed per page.

  - name: Versioning
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      Versioning can be specified in three different ways:


      #### URL Path Versioning

      + `/v2/` is the only documented path, but only refers to the major version

      + A version specified via the URL path is a **required** part of the
      URL.

      + Only a major version can be specified via the URL path, i.e.
      `/v2.0.6/` is invalid, additionally, paths such as `/v2.0/` are invalid.

      + If the default version of the API is within the major version
      specified in the URL path, the default version will be applied (i.e. if
      the default version is `2.3` and the URL path is `/v2/`, then version
      returned will be `2.3`).

      + If the default version of the API is not within the major version
      specified in the URL path, the URL path version will be applied (i.e. if
      the default version is `3.0` and the URL path is `/v2/`, then the
      version returned will be `2.0`)


      #### Query Parameter Versioning

      + `/v2/nodes/?version=2.1.6`

      + Pinning to a specific version via a query parameter is **optional**.

      + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can
      be specified via the `version` query parameter, as long as it is an
      allowed version.

      + If the version specified in the query parameter does not fall within
      the same major version specified in the URL path, i.e
      `/v2/nodes/?version=3.1.4` a 409 Conflict response will be returned.


      #### Header Versioning

      + `Accept-Header=application/vnd.api+json;version=3.0.1`

      + Pinning to a specific version via request header is **optional**.

      + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can
      be specified via the `Accept Header` of the request, as long as it is an
      allowed version.

      + If the version specified in the header does not fall within the same
      major version specified in the URL path a 409 Conflict response will be
      returned.

      + If both a header version and query parameter version are specified,
      the versions must match exactly or a 409 Conflict response will be
      returned (i.e. one does not take precedence over the other).


      #### CHANGELOG

      `v2.1`

      + Pagination links conform to JSON API specification, i.e. `meta` information was pulled out of the `links` object and placed in a top-level `meta` object.

      + Deprecate the `node_links` field in the **Node** and **Registration** serializers in favor of `linked_nodes` and `linked_registrations`.


      `v2.2`

      + Modify institution nodes list so that affiliated components are also returned from `/v2/institutions/<id>/nodes/`.

      + Ensure all existing date fields are standardized on UTC.


      `v2.3`

      + Handle merged users more correctly on `/v2/users/`.


      `v2.4`

      + Deprecate the `parents` field in the **Taxonomies** serializer.

      + Deprecate the following fields in the **Preprint Provider** serializer:
          + `social_facebook`, `social_instagram`, and `social_twitter`
          + `banner_path`, `logo_path`, and `header_text`
          + `email_contact`

  - name: Filtering
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      Entity collections can be filtered by adding a query parameter in the
      form:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`filter[<fieldname>]=<matching information>`


      String queries are filtered using substring matching. For example, if
      you were trying to find [Lise Meitner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner):


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/users/?filter[full_name]=meitn`


      You can filter on multiple fields, or the same field in different ways, by &-ing the query parameters together.


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/users/?filter[full_name]=lise&filter[family_name]=mei`


      Boolean fields should be queried with `true` or `false`.


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[registered]=true`


      You can request multiple resources by filtering on id and placing comma-separated values in your query parameter.


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[id]=aegu6,me23a`


      You can filter with case-sensitivity or case-insensitivity by using `contains` and `icontains`, respectively.


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?filter[tags][icontains]=help`

  - name: Sparse Fieldsets
    x-traitTag: true
    description: |
      All endpoints respond to the `fields` query parameter as described in the [JSON-API spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets).


      From the specification:

      <blockquote>
        <p>A client MAY request that an endpoint return only specific fields in the response on a per-type basis by including a fields[TYPE] parameter.</p>
        <p>The value of the fields parameter MUST be a comma-separated (U+002C COMMA, “,”) list that refers to the name(s) of the fields to be returned.</p>
        <p>If a client requests a restricted set of fields for a given resource type, an endpoint MUST NOT include additional fields in resource objects of that type in its response.</p>
      </blockquote>

      #### Basic Usage

      When making a request to an endpoint that returns a serialized object of some `type`, you can specify `fields[<type>]=<comma,separated,list,of,fields>` to receive a subset of the object's fields in the response.


      For example, the request below will serialize only the `title` attribute and `children` relationship for each node in the response.


      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?fields[nodes]=title,children


      Sparse fieldsets can be used to restrict both attribute and relationship fields.
      Note that top-level objects (such as `type`, `id`, `attributes`, `relationships`, and `links`) will always be serialized and cannot be excluded.

      #### Advanced Usage

      Sparse fieldsets can be used to restrict any entity returned in the response.


      For example, the request below will serialize only the `full_name` attribute for each user (auto-embedded by the `embed=contributors` query parameter), and the `title` attribute for each node.


      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?fields[nodes]=title,contributors&embed=contributors&fields[users]=full_name


      Any field specified in another query parameters used by the serializer (e.g. `embed`) must also be included in the sparse fieldset.
      For example, fields that are being embedded on the sparse type (e.g. `nodes`) must also be included in `fields[<type>]` when using embeds, or the embed will be invalid.


      A request to embed contributors and restrict nodes to only return the `title` attribute should have the form:


      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?embed=contributors&fields[nodes]=title,contributors


      **NOT**


      https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?embed=contributors&fields[nodes]=title

  - name: Embedding
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      All related resources that appear in the `relationships` attribute are embeddable,
      meaning it is possible to fetch a node and its contributors in a single request by adding a query parameter like:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?embed=contributors`


      The embedded results will have the following structure:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`{relationship_name}: {full_embedded_response}`


      Where `full_embedded_response` means the full API response resulting from a **GET** request to the `href` link of the corresponding related
      resource.


      This means if there are no errors in processing the embedded request the response will have the format:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`data: {response}`


      And if there are errors processing the embedded request the response will have the format:


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`errors: {errors}`


      Multiple embeds can be achieved with multiple query parameters separated by "&".


      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`/nodes/?embed=contributors&embed=comments`


      Some endpoints are automatically embedded, such as the [node contributors](#operation/nodes_contributors_list) endpoint, which automatically embeds user information.

  - name: Request Formatting
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      ## Attribute Validation

      Endpoints that allow creation or modification of entities generally limit updates to certain attributes of the entity.


      If you attempt to set an attribute that does not permit updates (such as a `date_created` timestamp), the API will silently ignore that attribute.


      This will not affect the response from the API: if the request would have succeeded without the updated attribute, it will still report as successful.
      Likewise, if the request would have failed without the attribute update, the API will still report a failure.


      Typoed or non-existent attributes will behave the same as non-updatable attributes and will be silently ignored.
      If a request is not working the way you expect, make sure to double check your spelling.

      ## Create/Update Requests

      #### Formatting POST/PUT/PATCH Request Bodies

      The OSF API follows the JSON-API spec for [create and update requests](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#crud).
      This means all request bodies must be wrapped with some metadata.


      Each request body must be an object with a `data` key containing at least a `type` member.
      The value of the `type` member must agree with the `type` of the entities represented by the endpoint.
      If not, a **409 Conflict** will be returned.


      The request should also contain an `attributes` member with an object containing the key-value pairs to be created/updated.


      **PUT/PATCH** requests must also have an `id` key that matches the ID part of the endpoint you are making a request to.
      If the `id` key does not match the ID part of the URL path, a **409 Conflict** error will be returned.


      #### Creating a Node via POST Example

          POST /v2/nodes/
          {
            "data": {
              "type": "nodes",
              "attributes": {
                "title" : "A Phylogenetic Tree of Famous Internet Cats",
                "category" : "project",
                "description" : "How closely related are Grumpy Cat and C.H. Cheezburger? Is memefulness inheritable?"
              }
            }
          }


      #### Updating a User via PUT Example

          PUT /v2/users/me/
          {
            "data": {
              "id": "3rqxc",
              "type": "users",
              "attributes": {
                "full_name" : "Henrietta Swan Leavitt",
                "given_name" : "Henrietta",
                "middle_names" : "Swan",
                "family_name" : "Leavitt"
              }
            }
          }

      **Note:** If you PUT/PATCH to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user id in the `id` field of the request.  We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.


      #### PUT vs. PATCH

      For most endpoints that support updates via **PUT** requests, we also allow **PATCH** updates.


      **PUT** requests require all mandatory attributes to be set, even if their value is unchanged.
      **PATCH** requests may omit mandatory attributes, whose value will be unchanged.

  - name: Errors & Error Codes
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      ## Errors

      When a request fails for any reason, the OSF API will return an appropriate HTTP response code and include a descriptive error in the body of the response.


      The response body will be a JSON object with a key, `errors`, pointing to an array of error objects.


      In general, these error objects will consist of a `detail` key with a detailed error message and a `source` object that may contain a field `pointer` that is a
      [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) to the error-causing attribute.


      The `error` objects may include additional information in accordance with the [JSON-API error spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#error-objects).


      #### Example

      An error response from an incorrect create node request:

          {
            "errors": [
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/attributes/category"
                },
                "detail": "This field is required."
              },
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/type"
                },
                "detail": "This field may not be null."
              },
              {
                "source": {
                  "pointer": "/data/attributes/title"
                },
                "detail": "This field is required."
              }
            ]
          }

      ## Error Codes

      The OSF API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.


      In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success,
      codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided
      (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, invalid authentication credentials were provided, etc.),
      and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with our API servers (these are rare, and if they occur consistently, should be [reported](mailto:support@osf.io)).


      `200` **OK**


      The request was successful and everything worked as expected.


      `201` **Created**


      The request was successful and a new resource was created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the ID returned in the response.


      `204` **No Content**


      The request was sucessful but does not need to return an entity-body.


      `400` **Bad Request**


      The request was unacceptable, often due to a missing required parameter or malformed data.


      `401` **Unauthorized**


      The request requires user authentication, which was not provided.


      `403` **Forbidden**


      The request was understood but not fulfilled, most likely due to invalid permissions.


      `404` **Not Found**


      The requested resource does not exist.


      `405` **Method Not Allowed**


      The method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource.


      `409` **Conflict**


      The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource or within the request data.


      `410` **Gone**


      The requested resource is no longer available, most likely because it was deleted.


      `429` **Too Many Requests**


      The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.


      Wait at least the amount of time specified in the `Retry-After` header of the response before sending another request.


      Authenticated requests have a rate limit of 10,000/day.


      Unauthenticated requests have a rate limit of 100/hour.


      `5xx` **Server Errors**


      The API server encountered an unexpected error.

  - name: Entities & Entity Collections
    x-traitTag: true
    description: >-
      ## Entities

      An entity is a single resource that has been retrieved from the API, usually from an endpoint with the entity's ID as the final path part.
      A successful response from an entity request will be a JSON object with a top level `data` key pointing to a sub-object with the following members:

      #### ID

      The identifier for the entity.  This **MUST** be included with all PUT and PATCH requests.

      #### Type

      The type identifier of this entity.  This **MUST** be included with all create and update requests.

      #### Attributes

      The properties of the entity.  Names, descriptions, etc.

      #### Relationships

      Relationships are URLs to other entities or entity collections that have a relationship to the entity.


      For example, the node entity provides a `contributors` relationship that points to the endpoint to retrieve all contributors to that node.
      It is recommended to use these links rather than to filter general entity collection endpoints by IDs.
      They'll be faster, easier, and less error-prone.


      Generally a relationship will have the following structure:


          {relationship_name}: {
            "links": {
              "related": {
                "href": {url_to_related_entity_or_entity_collection},
                "meta": {}
              }
            }
          }


      If there are no related entities, `href` will be null.

      #### Embeds

      Please see the [embedding](#tag/Embedding) documentation.

      #### Links

      Links are urls to alternative representations of the entity or actions that may be performed on the entity.


      Most entities will provide a `self` link that is the canonical endpoint for the entity where update and delete requests should be sent.
      Most entities will also provide an `html` link that directs to the entity's page on the Open Science Framework.

      ## Entity Collections

      Entity collection endpoints return a list of entities and an additional data structure with pagination links,
      such as `next`, `prev`, `first`, and `last`.


      The OSF API limits all entity collection responses to a maximum of 10 entities.


      The response object has two keys:

      #### Data

      The `data` key is an array of entities that match the query.


      Each entity in the array is the same representation that is returned from that entity's `self` link, meaning that refetching the entity is unnecessary.

      #### Links

      The `links` key contains pagination information, including links to the previous, next, first, and last pages of results.


      The `meta` key contains the total number of entities available, as well as the current number of results displayed per page.

      If there are only enough results to fill one page, the `first`, `last`, `prev`, and `next` values will be null.

      Addons represent a user connection to an external service, some addons allow for additional storage,
      some modify user authentication or add a redirect link to a project.

      This is the "home page" of the API you can get important autentication information for the user making
      the request and get links to other resources.

  - name: Registration Schemas
    description: >-
      A Registration Schemas defines the range of valid responses to a registration. Each Registration
      Schema is composed of <a href="#tag/Registration-Schema-Blocks">"blocks"</a> that define the individual questions a user responds to. Registration Schemas are
      created by the Center for Open Science or an affiliated institution and periodically migrated into the system.
      Registration Schemas are updated and deactivated using an internal versioning system.

  - name: Registration Schema Blocks
    description: >-
      Registration Schema Blocks are read-only entities, they represent question prompts and form inputs known as
      "blocks" that make up a Registration Schemas. Each block has a designated `block_type` that determines what type
      of information that Schema Block's corresponding block in the Schema Response.

  - name: Schema Responses
    description: >-
      Schema Responses contain user supplied responses to a Registration Schema. A Schema Response
      aggregates all of the the responses for a given version of a Registration's Registration Schema.
      Schema Responses are created when a Registration is completed. Once a Registration is completed the
      Schema Responses for a Registration can be revisied and updated by using it's associated action endpoints.


      There are a few states for Schema Responses:

        - `initial` is the state of a Schema Response on a newly registered Registration, to edit a Schema Response you
        must create a Schema Response Action that triggers a new submission.

        - `in_progess` is the state of a Schema Response where the response is editable and still private, Schema
        Responses are editted via a PATCH request as specified below.

        - `unapproved` is the state of a Schema Response where edits have been made and "locked-in", now contributors
        have the ability to reject the changes, however if they are not rejected changes are automatically approved
        after 48 hours. If `unapproved` Schema Responses are rejected, they are returned to the `in_progress` state. If
        `unapproved` Schema Responses are approved they either enter an `approved` state or go into a
        `pending_moderation` to be accepted or denied by a moderator.

        - `pending_moderation` is the state of a Schema Response where moderators have an opportunity to reject or
        approve a Schema Response that has been approved by it's contributors. This state is only reachable for Schema
        Responses that are associated with a Registration that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow.

        - `approved` is the state of a Schema Response where it is public and immutable, in order to update an approved
        Schema Response a new one must be created.

  - name: Schema Response Actions
    description: >-
      Schema Response Actions are objects that when created cause state transitions for Schema Responses.
      Users use state transitions to submit, approve, and revise new Schema Responses.


      Schema Response Actions have a few different triggers to cause state transitions:

        - `submit` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `in_progress` state to an `unapproved` state,
        this freezes edits for the Schema Response and allows all admin contributors to the Schema Response's
        Registration to either approved or reject the Schema Response.

        - `approve` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `unapproved` state to an `approved` state, this
        makes the Schema Response changes public completing the update of the Schema Response. On Schema Responses that
        are associated with a Registration that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow the `approve` trigger
        will transition the Schema Response to `pending_moderation`.

        - `accept` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `pending_moderation` state to an `approved`
        state. This trigger is only valid for Schema Responses that are associated with a Registration that has
        Registration Provider a moderated workflow and only possible for a user designated as moderator of a
        Registration Provider.

        - `admin_reject` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `unapproved` state to an
        `in_progress`  state. This trigger allows users to reject purposed changes to a Schema Response.

        - `moderator_reject` is a trigger to transition a Schema Response from an `pending_moderation` state to an
        `in_progress`  state. This trigger is only valid for Schema Responses that are associated with a Registration
        that has Registration Provider a moderated workflow and only possible for a user designated as moderator of a
        Registration Provider.
  - name: Draft Registrations
    description: >-

      A Draft Registration is a object that allows a user to edit and revise a registration before it is registered.
      Draft Registrations allow contributors to coordinate on a single registration, so they can upload files and change
      Registration metadata before the Registration is archived.
  - name: Collection Submissions

    description: >-

      A Collection Submission is an object that allows a user to add a resource, either a project, preprint, or
      registration to a collection. Once created, a Collection Submission may be automatically accepted or await
      moderation. Once a Collection Submission is in a moderation state, an assigned moderator may accept or reject the
      submission.

      There are a few states for Collection Submissions:

        - `in_progress` is the initial state of a Collection Submission where the resource is editable and still private.

        - `pending` is the state where the Collection Submission is awaiting moderation.

        - `accepted` means the Collection Submission has been approved and added to the collection.

        - `rejected` means the Collection Submission has been declined by the moderator.

        - `removed` means the Collection Submission has been removed from the collection, after initial acceptance.

  - name: Collection Submissions Actions

    description: >-
      A Collection Submission Action is an object that triggers a change in the moderation state of a Collection
      Submission and works as a record to log all previous transitions for a Collection Submission.

      Collection Submission Actions have a few different triggers to cause state transitions:

        - `submit` is used to move a Collection Submission from the `in_progress` to the `pending` state, indicating the
          submission is in a `pending` state, ready for moderation.

        - `accept` is used by moderators to approve a Collection Submission, changing its state to `accepted`.

        - `reject` is used by moderators to reject a Collection Submission, changing its state to `rejected`.

        - `remove` is used to permanently remove a Collection Submission from the moderation queue,
          changing its state to `removed`.

        - `resubmit` is used to resubmit a previously rejected or removed Collection Submission, moving it back to the
          `pending` state from the `rejected` or `removed` state.

        - `cancel` is used to cancel a Collection Submission in a `pending` state, reverting it back to the
          `in_progress`.

  - name: Collection Submissions Provider
    description: >-
      A Collection Submissions Provider represents the data for moderators and admins for a group of collections.
      It acts as a central hub for managing all collection submissions within various collections, ensuring that
      the moderation process is handled efficiently and consistently across different collections.

      The Collection Submissions Provider holds important information, such as the list of moderators and admins, and the
      moderation rules for all collections under its umbrella. Historical data about past collection submissions
      and their states is saved via Collection Submission Actions.

      Through the Collection Submissions Provider, moderators can oversee the state of all submissions in
      collections they manage, ensuring that each submission follows the appropriate state transitions and
      adheres to the standards set for collection submissions. It aids in providing transparency and order to the
      process of managing collections and ensures that moderators and admins have the tools and information they
      need to effectively manage collection submissions.
  - name: Regions
    description: >-
      Storage Regions are predefined geographical or cloud-storage areas where files are stored within OSF Storage.
  
      Each region provides isolation of data in compliance with geographic or regulatory requirements. Users can specify their preferred region for storing project files when using OSF Storage.
  
      **Attributes include:**
  
        - `id`: Unique identifier of the region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
