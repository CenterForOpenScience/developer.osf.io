  summary: List Notification Subscriptions for a Collection Provider
  description: >-
    Retrieve a paginated list of notification subscriptions associated with a specific collection provider
    for the authenticated user.

    Each subscription resource represents the user's notification preferences for specific events
    (e.g., new pending submissions) within the specified collection provider.

    ## Permissions
     - The user must be authenticated.
     - The user must have existing subscriptions for the specified collection provider.

    ## Response Format
     - Returns a JSON:API compliant response with a `data` array containing subscription resources.
     - Each subscription includes:
       - `event_name`: The event that triggers notifications (e.g., `new_pending_submissions`).
       - `frequency`: How often notifications are sent (`instant`, `daily`, `none`).
       - `provider`: Relationship object linking to the collection provider.

    ## Pagination
     - Standard JSON:API pagination links (`first`, `last`, `prev`, `next`) and `meta` information
      (e.g., `total`, `per_page`) are included in the response.
