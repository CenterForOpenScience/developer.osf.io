  summary: Retrieve a GUID resource or redirect to its referent resource
  description: |
    Retrieve a GUID object or be redirected to the most appropriate resource.

    By default, this endpoint redirects (`302 Found`) to the resource URL associated with the GUID.
    If `?resolve=false` is passed, it returns the GUID resource object instead of redirecting.

    GUIDs may reference nodes, registrations, files, collections, preprints, or users.

    ### Redirect Behavior
    - If the GUID refers to a supported resource, this will redirect to its detail endpoint.
    - If it refers to an unsupported type (e.g., wiki), `501 Not Implemented` is returned.
    - If the GUID is invalid or deleted, a `404` or `410` is returned.

    ### JSON Response Behavior
    - If `resolve=false` is used, a `200 OK` is returned with the GUID resource object.

    ### Permissions
    - Public GUIDs are accessible without authentication.
    - Private GUIDs require appropriate access permissions.
