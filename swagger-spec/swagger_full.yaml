        Welcome to the V2 Open Science Framework API. With this API you can
        access users, projects, components, logs, and files

        from the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). The Open Science
        Framework (OSF) is a free, open-source service

        maintained by the [Center for Open Science](http://cos.io/).


        The OSF serves as a repository and archive for study designs, materials,
        data, manuscripts, or anything else

        associated with your research during the research process. Every project
        and file on the OSF has a permanent unique

        identifier, and every registration (a permanent, time-stamped version of
        your projects and files) can be assigned a

        DOI/ARK. You can use the OSF to measure your impact by monitoring the
        traffic to projects and files you make

        public. With the OSF you have full control of what parts of your
        research are public and what remains private.


        Beta notice: This API is currently a beta service.  You are encouraged
        to use the API and will receive support

        when doing so, however, while the API remains in beta status, it may
        change without notice as a result of

        product updates. The temporary beta status of the API will remain in
        place while it matures. In a future

        release, the beta status will be removed, at which point we will provide
        details on how long we will support

        the API V2 and under what circumstances it might change.


        #General API Usage


        The OSF API generally conforms to the [JSON-API v1.0
        spec](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/).  Where exceptions

        exist, they will be noted.  Each endpoint will have its own
        documentation, but there are some general principles.


        Assume undocumented routes/features/fields are unstable.


        ##Requests


        ###Canonical URLs


        All canonical URLs have trailing slashes.  A request to an endpoint
        without a trailing slash will result in a 301

        redirect to the canonical URL.  There are some exceptions when working
        with the Files API, so if a URL in a response

        does not have a slash, do not append one.


        ###Plurals


        Endpoints are always pluralized.  `/users/`, not `/user/`, `/nodes/`,
        not `/node/`.


        ###Common Actions


        Every endpoint in the OSF API responds to `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTION`
        requests.  You must have adequate permissions

        to interact with the endpoint.  Unauthorized use will result in 401
        Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden responses.  Use

        `HEAD` to probe an endpoint and make sure your headers are well-formed. 
        `GET` will return a representation of the

        entity or entity collection referenced by the endpoint.  An `OPTIONS`
        request will return a JSON object that describes the

        endpoint, including the name, a description, the acceptable request
        formats, the allowed response formats, and any

        actions available via the endpoint.


        ###Versioning

        Versioning can be specified in three different ways:


        1. URL Path Versioning, e.g. `/v2/` or `/v3/`


        + A version specified via the URL path is a **required** part of the
        URL.


        + Only a major version can be specified via the URL path, i.e.
        `/v2.0.6/` is invalid,

        additionally, paths such as `/v2.0/` are invalid.


        + If the default version of the API is within the major version
        specified in the URL path,

        the default version will be applied (i.e. if the default version is
        `2.3` and the URL path is `/v2/`,

        then version returned will be `2.3`).


        + If the default version of the API is not within the major version
        specified in the URL path,

        the URL path version will be applied (i.e. if the default version is
        `3.0` and the URL path is `/v2/`,

        then the version returned will be `2.0`)


        2. Query Parameter Versioning, e.g. `/v2/nodes/?version=2.1.6`


        + Pinning to a specific version via a query parameter is **optional**.


        + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can
        be specified via the `version`

        query parameter, as long as it is an allowed version.


        + If the version specified in the query parameter does not fall within
        the same major version

        specified in the URL path, i.e `/v2/nodes/?version=3.1.4` a `409
        Conflict` response will be returned.


        3.  Header Versioning, e.g.
        `Accept-Header=application/vnd.api+json;version=3.0.1`


        + Pinning to a specific version via request header is **optional**.


        + A specific version (major, minor, or patch) for a single request can
        be specified

        via the `Accept Header` of the request, as long as it is an allowed
        version.


        + If the version specified in the header does not fall within the same
        major version specified

        in the URL path a `409 Conflict` response will be returned.


        + If both a header version and query parameter version are specified,
        the versions must match exactly

        or a `409 Conflict` response will be returned (i.e. one does not take
        precedence over the other).


        ###Filtering


        Entity collections can be filtered by adding a query parameter in the
        form:


        filter[<fieldname>]=<matching information>


        String queries are filtered using substring matching. For example, if
        you were trying to find [Lise

        Meitner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner):


        /users/?filter[full_name]=meitn


        You can filter on multiple fields, or the same field in different ways,
        by &-ing the query parameters together.


        /users/?filter[full_name]=lise&filter[family_name]=mei


        Boolean fields should be queried with `true` or `false`.


        /nodes/?filter[registered]=true


        You can request multiple resources by filtering on id and placing
        comma-separated values in your query parameter.


        /nodes/?filter[id]=aegu6,me23a


        You can filter with case-sensitivity or case-insensitivity by using
        `contains` and `icontains`, respectively.


        /nodes/?filter[tags][icontains]=help


        ###Embedding


        All related resources that appear in the `relationships` attribute are
        embeddable, meaning that

        by adding a query parameter like:


        /nodes/?embed=contributors


        it is possible to fetch a Node and its contributors in a single request.
        The embedded results will have the following

        Linked nodes are the project/component nodes pointed to by node links.
        This view will probably replace node_links in the near future.


        <!--- Copied Spiel from NodeDetail -->


        On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The
        difference between a project and a component

        is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of
        the project. There is also a [category

        field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option.
        The categorization essentially determines

        which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with
        search organization. Top-level nodes may have

        a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of
        project.

        See the [JSON-API spec regarding

        ##Query Params


        + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1


        + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search
        results on.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`,
        `public`, `registration`, or `tags`.  `title`,

        `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filtered
        using simple substring matching.  `public` and

        Linked registrations are the registration nodes pointed to by node
        links.


        <!--- Copied Spiel from RegistrationDetail -->

        Registrations are read-only snapshots of a project. This view shows
        details about the given registration.


        Each resource contains the full representation of the registration,
        meaning additional requests to an individual

        registration's detail view are not necessary. A withdrawn registration
        will display a limited subset of information,

        namely, title, description, date_created, registration, withdrawn,
        date_registered, withdrawal_justification, and

        registration supplement. All other fields will be displayed as null.
        Additionally, the only relationships permitted

        to be accessed for a withdrawn registration are the contributors - other
        relationships will return a 403.

        + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1


        + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search
        results on.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`,
        `public`, `registration`, or `tags`.  `title`,

        `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filtered
        using simple substring matching.  `public` and

        `registration` are booleans, and can be filtered using truthy values,
        such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note

        that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail
        regardless.  `tags` is an array of simple strings.

        # Deprecated


        The use of /collections/ID/node_links/ is deprecated in favor of

        ## Known Issue


        Linked nodes of type 'registrations' will be returned with an error 'Not
        found.' in the {embeds: target_node: {}} object.



        Node Links act as pointers to other nodes. Unlike Forks, they are not

        List of reports made for a comment. *Writeable*.


        Paginated list of reports for a comment. Each resource contains the full
        representation of the

        report, meaning additional requests to an individual comment's report
        detail view are not necessary.


        ###Permissions


        The comment reports endpoint can only be viewed by users with permission
        to comment on the node. Users

        are only shown comment reports that they have made.


        ##Attributes


        OSF comment report entities have the "comment_reports" `type`.

        Welcome to the Files API.  Brace yourself, things are about to get
        *weird*.


        The Files API is the one place in the OSF API where we break hard from
        the JSON-API spec.  This is because most of

        the behind-the-scenes moving, uploading, deleting, etc. of files and
        folders is actually handled for us by a

        nifty piece of software called
        [WaterButler](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/waterbutler). 
        WaterButler lets

        us interact with files stored on different cloud storage platforms
        through a consistent API.  However, it uses

        different conventions for requests, responses, and URL-building, so pay
        close attention to the documentation for

        [actions](#actions).  The exception is the "Get Info" action, which is
        OSF-centric.


        Only files and folders which have previously been retrieved through the
        Node Files List endpoint (accessible through

        the `files` relationship of their parent nodes) can be accessed through
        this endpoint.  Viewing a folder through the

        Node Files List vivifies their children's metadata in the OSF and allows
        the children to be assigned ids.  This

        metadata is cached and can be refreshed by GETting the file via the Node
        Files List endpoint.


        Both files and folders are available through the Files API and are
        distinguished by the `kind` attribute ("file" for

        files, "folder" for folders).  Not all actions and relationships are
        relevant to both files and folders, so the

        applicable types are listed by each heading.


        ###Waterbutler Entities


        When an action is performed against a WaterButler endpoint, it will
        generally respond with a file entity, a folder

        entity, or no content.

        ####Folder Entity

        extra         object  varies depending on provider



        ##Attributes


        For an OSF File entity, the `type` is "files" regardless of whether the
        entity is actually a file or folder, because

        it belongs to the `files` collection of the API.  They can be
        distinguished by the `kind` attribute.  Files and

        folders use the same representation, but some attributes may be null for
        one kind but not the other. `size` will be

        null for folders.  A list of storage provider keys can be found
        [here](/v2/#storage-providers).


        name                        type               description

        ================================================================================================================

        folder; used for display

        kind                        string             "file" or "folder"

        the file relative to the provider root

        null for folders

        provider                    string             storage provider for this
        file. "osfstorage" if stored on the

        OSF.  other examples include "s3" for Amazon S3, "googledrive"

        for Google Drive, "box" for Box.com.

        current_user_can_comment    boolean            Whether the current user

        file was last updated*

        date_created                iso8601 timestamp  timestamp of when this
        file was created*

        extra                       object             may contain additional
        data beyond what's described here,

        md5                         string             md5 hash of file, null

        sha256                      string             SHA-256 hash of file,
        null for folders


        * A note on timestamps: for files stored in osfstorage, `date_created`
        refers to the time the file was

        first uploaded to osfstorage, and `date_modified` is the time the file
        was last updated while in osfstorage.

        Other providers may or may not provide this information, but if they do

        ##Relationships


        ###Node


        The `node` endpoint describes the project or registration that this file
        belongs to.


        ###Files (*folders*)


        The `files` endpoint lists all of the subfiles and folders of the
        current folder. Will be null for files.


        ###Versions (*files*)


        The `versions` endpoint provides version history for files.  Will be
        null for folders.

        Welcome to the Files API.  Brace yourself, things are about to get
        *weird*.


        The Files API is the one place in the OSF API where we break hard from
        the JSON-API spec.  This is because most of

        the behind-the-scenes moving, uploading, deleting, etc. of files and
        folders is actually handled for us by a

        nifty piece of software called
        [WaterButler](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/waterbutler). 
        WaterButler lets

        us interact with files stored on different cloud storage platforms
        through a consistent API.  However, it uses

        different conventions for requests, responses, and URL-building, so pay
        close attention to the documentation for

        [actions](#actions).  The exception is the "Get Info" action, which is
        OSF-centric.


        Only files and folders which have previously been retrieved through the
        Node Files List endpoint (accessible through

        the `files` relationship of their parent nodes) can be accessed through
        this endpoint.  Viewing a folder through the

        Node Files List vivifies their children's metadata in the OSF and allows
        the children to be assigned ids.  This

        metadata is cached and can be refreshed by GETting the file via the Node
        Files List endpoint.


        Both files and folders are available through the Files API and are
        distinguished by the `kind` attribute ("file" for

        files, "folder" for folders).  Not all actions and relationships are
        relevant to both files and folders, so the

        applicable types are listed by each heading.


        ###Waterbutler Entities


        When an action is performed against a WaterButler endpoint, it will
        generally respond with a file entity, a folder

        entity, or no content.


        ####File Entity

        "s3", "googledrive".

        etag          string  etag - http caching identifier w/o wrapping quotes

        extra         object  varies depending on provider



        ##Attributes


        For an OSF File entity, the `type` is "files" regardless of whether the
        entity is actually a file or folder, because

        it belongs to the `files` collection of the API.  They can be
        distinguished by the `kind` attribute.  Files and

        folders use the same representation, but some attributes may be null for
        one kind but not the other. `size` will be

        null for folders.  A list of storage provider keys can be found
        [here](/v2/#storage-providers).


        name                        type               description

        ================================================================================================================

        folder; used for display

        kind                        string             "file" or "folder"

        WaterButler entity

        materialized_path           string             the unix-style path to
        the file relative to the provider root

        size                        integer            size of file in bytes,
        null for folders

        provider                    string             storage provider for this
        file. "osfstorage" if stored on the

        OSF.  other examples include "s3" for Amazon S3, "googledrive"

        for Google Drive, "box" for Box.com.

        current_user_can_comment    boolean            Whether the current user
        is allowed to post comments


        last_touched                iso8601 timestamp  last time the metadata
        for the file was retrieved. only

        applies to non-OSF storage providers.

        date_modified               iso8601 timestamp  timestamp of when this
        file was last updated*

        date_created                iso8601 timestamp  timestamp of when this
        file was created*

        extra                       object             may contain additional
        data beyond what's described here,

        depending on the provider

        hashes                      object

        md5                         string             md5 hash of file, null
        for folders

        sha256                      string             SHA-256 hash of file,
        null for folders


        * A note on timestamps: for files stored in osfstorage, `date_created`
        refers to the time the file was

        first uploaded to osfstorage, and `date_modified` is the time the file
        was last updated while in osfstorage.

        Other providers may or may not provide this information, but if they do
        it will correspond to the provider's

        semantics for created/modified times.  These timestamps may also be
        stale; metadata retrieved via the File Detail

        endpoint is cached.  The `last_touched` field describes the last time
        the metadata was retrieved from the external

        provider.  To force a metadata update, access the parent folder via its
        Node Files List endpoint.

        created/modified.


        <!--- Copied Spiel from FileVersionDetail -->


        A specific version of an uploaded file.  Note that the version is tied
        to the id/path, so two versions of the same

        file could have completely different contents and formats.  That's on
        you, though.  Don't do that.


        Unlike the OSF File entity which can represent files and folders,
        FileVersions only ever represent files. When a

        file is first uploaded to the "osfstorage" provider through the API it
        is assigned version 1.  Each time it is

        updated through the API, the version number is incremented.  Files
        stored on other providers will follow that

        provider's versioning semantics.

        This endpoint will redirect you to the most appropriate URL given an OSF
        GUID. For example, /v2/guids/{node_id},

        will redirect to /v2/nodes/{node_id} while /v2/guids/{user_id} will
        redirect to /v2/users/{user_id}. If the GUID

        does not resolve, you will receive a 410 GONE response. If the GUID
        corresponds to an item that does not have a

        corresponding endpoint (e.g. wiki pages), you will receive a 501
        NOT_IMPLEMENTED response.

        Nodes that represent projects and components. *Writeable*.


        Paginated list of nodes ordered by their `date_modified`.  Each resource
        contains the full representation of the

        node, meaning additional requests to an individual node's detail view
        are not necessary.  Registrations and withdrawn

        registrations cannot be accessed through this endpoint (see registration
        endpoints instead).


        <!--- Copied Spiel from NodeDetail -->


        On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The
        difference between a project and a component

        is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of
        the project. There is also a [category

        field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option.
        The categorization essentially determines

        which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with
        search organization. Top-level nodes may have

        a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of
        project.

        On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The
        difference between a project and a component

        is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of
        the project. There is also a [category

        field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option.
        The categorization essentially determines

        which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with
        search organization. Top-level nodes may have

        a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of
        project.


        ###Permissions


        Nodes that are made public will give read-only access to everyone.
        Private nodes require explicit read

        permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private
        nodes. Administrators on a parent node have

        implicit read permissions for all child nodes.

        A registration or withdrawn registration cannot be accessed through this
        endpoint. See Registration Detail endpoint.


        On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The
        difference between a project and a component

        is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of
        the project. There is also a [category

        field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option.
        The categorization essentially determines

        which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with
        search organization. Top-level nodes may have

        a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of
        project.


        ###Permissions


        Nodes that are made public will give read-only access to everyone.
        Private nodes require explicit read

        permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private
        nodes. Administrators on a parent node have

        implicit read permissions for all child nodes.


        ##Attributes


        OSF Node entities have the "nodes" `type`.

        Attributes other than `enabled` will be null if the addon is not enabled
        for this node.


        ##Permissions


        <Addon>NodeSettings that are attached to public Nodes will give
        read-only access to everyone. Private nodes require explicit read

        permission. Write and admin access are the same for public and private
        nodes. Administrators on a parent node have

        implicit read permissions for all child nodes.


        Any users with write or admin access to the node are able to deauthorize
        an enabled addon, but only the addon authorizer is able

        to change the configuration (i.e. selected folder) of an
        already-configured <Addon>NodeSettings entity.


        ## <Addon>NodeSettings Attributes


        OSF <Addon>NodeSettings entities have the "node_addons" `type`, and
        their `id` indicates the addon

        service provider (eg. `box`, `googledrive`, etc).

        <!--- Copied partially from NodeDraftRegistrationDetail -->


        Draft registrations contain the supplemental registration questions that
        accompany a registration. A registration

        is a frozen version of the project that can never be edited or deleted
        but can be withdrawn.

        Your original project remains editable but will now have the
        registration linked to it.


        ###Permissions

        Draft registrations contain the supplemental registration questions that
        accompany a registration. A registration

        is a frozen version of the project that can never be edited or deleted
        but can be withdrawn.

        Your original project remains editable but will now have the
        registration linked to it.

        List of storage providers enabled for this node. *Read-only*.


        Users of the OSF may access their data on a [number of
        cloud-storage](/v2/#storage-providers) services that have

        integrations with the OSF.  We call these "providers".  By default every
        node has access to the OSF-provided

        storage but may use as many of the supported providers as desired.  This
        endpoint lists all of the providers that are

        configured for this node.  If you want to add more, you will need to do
        that in the Open Science Framework front end

        for now.


        In the OSF filesystem model, providers are treated as folders, but with
        special properties that distinguish them

        from regular folders.  Every provider folder is considered a root
        folder, and may not be deleted through the regular

        file API.  To see the contents of the provider, issue a GET request to
        the `/relationships/files/links/related/href`

        attribute of the provider resource.  The `new_folder` and `upload`
        actions are handled by another service called

        WaterButler, whose response format differs slightly from the OSF's.

        ###Waterbutler Entities


        When an action is performed against a WaterButler endpoint, it will
        generally respond with a file entity, a folder

        entity, or no content.

        Files attached to a node for a given provider. *Read-only*.


        This gives a list of all of the files and folders that are attached to
        your project for the given storage provider.

        If the provider is not "osfstorage", the metadata for the files in the
        storage will be retrieved and cached whenever

        this endpoint is accessed.  To see the cached metadata, GET the endpoint
        for the file directly (available through

        its `/links/info` attribute).


        When a create/update/delete action is performed against the file or
        folder, the action is handled by an external

        service called WaterButler.  The WaterButler response format differs
        slightly from the OSF's.

        ###Waterbutler Entities


        When an action is performed against a WaterButler endpoint, it will
        generally respond with a file entity, a folder

        entity, or no content.

        extra         object  varies depending on provider


        ##File Attributes


        <!--- Copied Attributes from FileDetail -->


        For an OSF File entity, the `type` is "files" regardless of whether the
        entity is actually a file or folder.  They

        can be distinguished by the `kind` attribute.  Files and folders use the
        same representation, but some attributes may

        be null for one kind but not the other. `size` will be null for
        folders.  A list of storage provider keys can be

        found [here](/v2/#storage-providers).


        name          type               description

        ===================================================================================================

        guid              string             OSF GUID for this file (if one has
        been assigned)

        name              string             name of the file or folder; used
        for display

        kind              string             "file" or "folder"

        path              string             same as for corresponding
        WaterButler entity

        materialized_path string             the unix-style path to the file
        relative to the provider root

        size              integer            size of file in bytes, null for
        folders

        provider          string             storage provider for this file.
        "osfstorage" if stored on the

        OSF.  other examples include "s3" for Amazon S3, "googledrive"

        for Google Drive, "box" for Box.com.

        last_touched      iso8601 timestamp  last time the metadata for the file
        was retrieved. only

        applies to non-OSF storage providers.

        date_modified     iso8601 timestamp  timestamp of when this file was
        last updated*

        date_created      iso8601 timestamp  timestamp of when this file was
        created*

        extra             object             may contain additional data beyond
        what's described here,

        depending on the provider

        hashes          object

        md5           string             md5 hash of file, null for folders

        sha256        string             SHA-256 hash of file, null for folders

        downloads       integer            number of times the file has been
        downloaded (for osfstorage files)


        * A note on timestamps: for files stored in osfstorage, `date_created`
        refers to the time the file was

        first uploaded to osfstorage, and `date_modified` is the time the file
        was last updated while in osfstorage.

        Other providers may or may not provide this information, but if they do
        it will correspond to the provider's

        semantics for created/modified times.  These timestamps may also be
        stale; metadata retrieved via the File Detail

        endpoint is cached.  The `last_touched` field describes the last time
        the metadata was retrieved from the external

        provider.  To force a metadata update, access the parent folder via its
        Node Files List endpoint.

        Linked nodes are the nodes pointed to by node links. This view will
        probably replace node_links in the near future.


        <!--- Copied Spiel from NodeDetail -->


        On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The
        difference between a project and a component

        is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of
        the project. There is also a [category

        field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option.
        The categorization essentially determines

        which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with
        search organization. Top-level nodes may have

        a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of
        project.


        ##Linked Node Attributes


        <!--- Copied Attributes from NodeDetail -->


        OSF Node entities have the "nodes" `type`.

        category       string             node category, must be one of the
        allowed values

        date_created   iso8601 timestamp  timestamp that the node was created

        date_modified  iso8601 timestamp  timestamp when the node was last
        updated

        tags           array of strings   list of tags that describe the node

        registration   boolean            is this is a registration?

        collection     boolean            is this node a collection of other
        nodes?

        public         boolean            has this node been made
        publicly-visible?

        See the [JSON-API spec regarding
        pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).


        ##Query Params


        + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1


        + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search
        results on.


        Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`,
        `public`, `registration`, or `tags`.  `title`,

        `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filtered
        using simple substring matching.  `public` and

        `registration` are booleans, and can be filtered using truthy values,
        such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note

        that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail
        regardless.  `tags` is an array of simple strings.

        Registrations of the current node.


        Registrations are read-only snapshots of a project that can never be
        edited or deleted but can be withdrawn. This view

        is a list of all the registrations and withdrawn registrations of the
        current node. To create a registration, first

        create a draft registration and answer the required supplemental
        registration questions. Then, submit a POST request

        to this endpoint with the draft registration id in the body of the
        request.


        <!--- Copied from RegistrationList -->


        A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information,
        namely, title, description,

        date_created, registration, withdrawn, date_registered,
        withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All

        other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only
        relationships permitted to be accessed for a withdrawn

        registration are the contributors - other relationships will return a
        403. Each resource contains the full representation

        of the registration, meaning additional requests to an individual
        registrations's detail view are not necessary.

        Paginated list of the node's current wiki page versions ordered by their
        `date_modified.` Each resource contains the

        full representation of the wiki, meaning additional requests to an
        individual wiki's detail view are not necessary.


        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, the user
        relationship will not be exposed.


        ###Permissions


        Wiki pages on public nodes are given read-only access to everyone. Wiki
        pages on private nodes are only visible to

        contributors and administrators on the parent node.

        pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).


        ##Query Params


        + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1


        + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search
        results on.


        Preprints may be filtered by their `id`, `is_published`, `date_created`,
        `date_modified`, `provider`

        Most are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring
        matching.


        ###Creating New Preprints


        Create a new preprint by posting to the guid of the existing **node**,
        including the file_id for the

        file you'd like to make the primary preprint file. Note that the **node
        id** will not be accessible via the

        preprints detail view until after the preprint has been created.

        Node Registrations.


        Registrations are read-only snapshots of a project. This view is a list
        of all current registrations for which a user

        has access.  A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of
        information, namely, title, description,

        date_created, registration, withdrawn, date_registered,
        withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All

        other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only
        relationships permitted to be accessed for a withdrawn

        registration are the contributors - other relationships will return a
        403.


        Each resource contains the full representation of the registration,
        meaning additional requests to an individual

        registrations's detail view are not necessary.  Unregistered nodes
        cannot be accessed through this endpoint.

        This will get the next level of child nodes for the selected node if the
        current user has read access for those

        nodes. Creating a node via this endpoint will behave the same as the
        [node list endpoint](/v2/nodes/), but the new

        node will have the selected node set as its parent.

        ##Query Params


        + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1


        + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search
        results on.


        <!--- Copied Query Params from NodeList -->


        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`,
        `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`,

        `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.  Most are string fields and will
        be filtered using simple substring matching.  `public`

        is a boolean, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`,
        `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note that quoting `true`

        or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail regardless.  `tags`
        is an array of simple strings.

        Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case
        of private nodes,

        have read access to the node. Contributors are divided between
        'bibliographic' and 'non-bibliographic'

        contributors. From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but
        bibliographic contributors

        are included in citations, while non-bibliographic contributors are not
        included in citations.


        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, the user
        relationship will not be exposed and the id for

        the contributor will be an empty string.

        Components that have been found by the given Elasticsearch query.


        <!--- Copied piel from NodeDetail -->


        On the front end, nodes are considered 'projects' or 'components'. The
        difference between a project and a component

        is that a project is the top-level node, and components are children of
        the project. There is also a [category

        field](/v2/#osf-node-categories) that includes 'project' as an option.
        The categorization essentially determines

        which icon is displayed by the node in the front-end UI and helps with
        search organization. Top-level nodes may have

        a category other than project, and children nodes may have a category of
        project.

        ##Attributes


        For an OSF File entity, the `type` is "files" regardless of whether the
        entity is actually a file or folder, because

        it belongs to the `files` collection of the API.  They can be
        distinguished by the `kind` attribute.  Files and

        folders use the same representation, but some attributes may be null for
        one kind but not the other. `size` will be

        null for folders.  A list of storage provider keys can be found
        [here](/v2/#storage-providers).

        null for folders


        * A note on timestamps: for files stored in osfstorage, `date_created`
        refers to the time the file was

        first uploaded to osfstorage, and `date_modified` is the time the file
        was last updated while in osfstorage.

        Other providers may or may not provide this information, but if they do
        it will correspond to the provider's

        semantics for created/modified times.  These timestamps may also be
        stale; metadata retrieved via the File Detail

        endpoint is cached.  The `last_touched` field describes the last time
        the metadata was retrieved from the external

        provider.  To force a metadata update, access the parent folder via its
        Node Files List endpoint.

        Registrations are read-only snapshots of a project. This view is a list
        of all current registrations for which a user

        has access.  A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of
        information, namely, title, description,

        date_created, registration, withdrawn, date_registered,
        withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All

        other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only
        relationships permitted to be accessed for a withdrawn

        registration are the contributors - other relationships will return a
        403.


        Each resource contains the full representation of the registration,
        meaning additional requests to an individual

        registrations's detail view are not necessary.  Unregistered nodes
        cannot be accessed through this endpoint.

        ##Relationships


        ###Registered from


        The registration is branched from this node.


        ###Registered by


        The registration was initiated by this user.


        ###Other Relationships


        See documentation on registered_from detail view.  A registration has
        many of the same properties as a node.

        Users that have been found by the given Elasticsearch query.


        <!-- Copied spiel from UserDetail -->


        The User Detail endpoint retrieves information about the user whose id
        is the final part of the path.  If `me`

        is given as the id, the record of the currently logged-in user will be
        returned.  The returned information includes

        the user's bibliographic information and the date the user registered.


        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, user information
        will not be serialized, and the id will be

        an empty string. Relationships to a user object will not show in this
        case, either.

        List of users registered on the OSF.


        Paginated list of users ordered by the date they registered.  Each
        resource contains the full representation of the

        user, meaning additional requests to an individual user's detail view
        are not necessary.


        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, user information
        will not be serialized, and the id will be

        an empty string. Relationships to a user object will not show in this
        case, either.


        The subroute [`/me/`](me/) is a special endpoint that always points to

        The User Detail endpoint retrieves information about the user whose id
        is the final part of the path.  If `me`

        is given as the id, the record of the currently logged-in user will be
        returned.  The returned information includes

        the user's bibliographic information and the date the user registered.


        Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used, user information
        will not be serialized, and the id will be

        an empty string. Relationships to a user object will not show in this
        case, either.

        List of nodes that the user contributes to. *Read-only*.


        Paginated list of nodes that the user contributes to ordered by
        `date_modified`.  User registrations are not available

        at this endpoint. Each resource contains the full representation of the
        node, meaning additional requests to an individual

        node's detail view are not necessary. If the user id in the path is the
        same as the logged-in user, all nodes will be

        visible.  Otherwise, you will only be able to see the other user's
        publicly-visible nodes.  The special user id `me`

        can be used to represent the currently logged-in user.

        ##Query Params


        + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1


        + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search
        results on.


        <!--- Copied Query Params from NodeList -->


        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`,
        `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`,

        `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.  Most are string fields and will
        be filtered using simple substring matching.  `public`

        is a boolean, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`,
        `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note that quoting `true`

        or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail regardless.  `tags`
        is an array of simple strings.

        List of registrations that the user contributes to. *Read-only*.


        Paginated list of registrations that the user contributes to.  Each
        resource contains the full representation of the

        registration, meaning additional requests to an individual
        registration's detail view are not necessary. If the user

        id in the path is the same as the logged-in user, all nodes will be
        visible.  Otherwise, you will only be able to

        see the other user's publicly-visible nodes.  The special user id `me`
        can be used to represent the currently

        logged-in user.


        A withdrawn registration will display a limited subset of information,
        namely, title, description,

        date_created, registration, withdrawn, date_registered,
        withdrawal_justification, and registration supplement. All

        other fields will be displayed as null. Additionally, the only
        relationships permitted to be accessed for a withdrawn

        registration are the contributors - other relationships will return a
        403.
