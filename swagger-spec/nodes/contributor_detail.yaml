get:
  summary: Retrieve a contributor
  description: >-
    Retrieves the details of a given contributor.


    Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.


    Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic".
    From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested
    contributor, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.

patch:
  summary: Update a contributor
  description: >-
    Updates a contributor by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body.
    Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.


    Contributors can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request.
    Since this endpoint has no mandatory attributes, PUT and PATCH are functionally the same.

    #### Permissions

    Only project administrators can update the contributors on a node.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated
    contributor, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.


    If the given user is not already in the contributor list, a 404 Not Found error will be returned.
    A node must always have at least one admin, and any attempt to downgrade the permissions of a sole admin will result in a 400 Bad Request error.

delete:
  summary: Delete a contributor
  description: >-
    Removes a contributor from a node.
    This request only removes the relationship between the node and the user, it does not delete the user itself.


    A node must always have at least one admin, and attempting to remove the only admin from a node will result in a **400 Bad Request** response.

    #### Permissions

    A user can remove themselves as a node contributor. Otherwise, only project administrators can remove contributors.

    #### Returns

    If the request is successful, no content is returned.


    If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
