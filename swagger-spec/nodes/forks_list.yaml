  summary: Create a fork of this node
  description: >-
    Creates a fork of the given node.


    Forking a project creates a copy of an existing node and all of its contents.
    The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.


    You might use a fork to copy another's work to build on and extend.
    For example, a professor may create an OSF project of materials for individual student use.
    Each student forks the project to have his or her own copy of the materials to start his/her own work.


    When creating a fork, your fork will only contain public components of the current node and components for which you are a contributor.
    Private components that you do not have access to will not be forked.

    #### Required

    There are no required attributes when creating a fork, as all of the forked node's attributes will be copied from the current node.


    The `title` field is optional, with the default title being "Fork of " prepended to the current node's title.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the complete srepresentation of the forked node, if the request is successful.

    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

get:
  summary: List all forks of this node
  description: >-

    A paginated list of the current node's forks.
    The returned fork nodes are sorted by their `forked_date`, with the most recently forked nodes appearing first.


    Forking a project creates a copy of an existing node and all of its contents.
    The fork always points back to the original node, forming a network of nodes.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 forked nodes.
    If the current node has zero forked nodes, the `data` key will contain an empty array.
    Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the forked node, meaning additional requests to the forked node's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


    This request should never return an error.
