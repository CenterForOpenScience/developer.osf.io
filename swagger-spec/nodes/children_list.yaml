get:
  summary: 'List all child nodes'
  description: >-

    A paginated list of the next level child nodes for the given node.
    The returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated child nodes appearing first.


    The list will include child nodes that are public, as well as child nodes that are private, if the authenticated user has permission to view them.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 child nodes.
    If the given node has zero child nodes, the `data` key will contain an empty array.
    Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the child node, meaning additional requests to the child node's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


    This request should never return an error.

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/children/?filter[title]=reproducibility.


    Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.


    Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.
    Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**.
    Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.

              description: Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent
                to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications
                of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology
                journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication
                effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial
                decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant
                results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results;
                47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication
                effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original
                result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and
                replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational
                tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength
                of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication
                teams.

  summary: Create a child node
  description: >-
    Creates a new child node.


    Note: Creating a child node via this endpoint will function the same as creating a node via the node list endpoint,
    but the child node will have the given node set as its parent.

    #### Permissions

    Only write contributors may create children nodes.

    #### Required

    Required fields for creating a node include:


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`title`


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`category`


    Note: nodes default to **private** unless the `public` field is explicitly set to **true** in the request payload.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created node, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
