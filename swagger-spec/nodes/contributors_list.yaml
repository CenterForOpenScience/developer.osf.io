  summary: List all contributors
  description: >-
    A paginated list of the node's contributors, sorted by their index.


    Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.


    Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic".
    From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.


    Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.


    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 contributors.
    Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor, meaning additional requests to a contributor's detail view are not necessary.
    Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9jdt/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.


    Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.

  summary: Create a contributor
  description: >-
    Adds a contributor to a node, effectively creating a relationship between the node and a user.


    Contributors are users who can make changes to the node or, in the case of private nodes, have read access to the node.


    Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic" contributors.
    From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

    #### Permissions

    Only project administrators can add contributors to a node.

    #### Required

    A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.


    All attributes describing the relationship between the node and the user are optional.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
