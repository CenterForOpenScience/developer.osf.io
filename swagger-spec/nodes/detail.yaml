  summary: Retrieve a node
  description: >-
    Retrieves the details of a given node (project or component).

    #### Permissions

    Only project contributors may retrieve the details of a private node.
    Attempting to retreive a private node for which you are not a contributor will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.


    Authentication is not required to view the details of a public node, as public nodes give read-only access to everyone.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested
    node, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.

patch:
  summary: Update a node
  description: >-
    Updates a node by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body.
    Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.


    Nodes can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request.
    The `title` and `category` fields are mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.

    #### Permissions

    Only write contributors may update a node.
    Attempting to update a node for which you do not have write access will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated
    node, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
