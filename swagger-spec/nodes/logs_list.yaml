# /nodes/{node_id}/logs/
get:
  summary: List all logs
  description: >-
    A paginated list of all logs associated with a given node.


    The returned logs are sorted by their `date`, with the most recents logs appearing
    first.


    This list includes the logs of the specified node as well as
    the logs of that node's children to which the current user has read-only access.


    ####Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of up to 10 logs.
    Each resource in the array is a separate logs object.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

    ####Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include logs that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/logs/?filter[action]=made_private.


    Nodes may be filtered by their `action`, and `date`.
