get:
  summary: Retrieve Identifiers for a Node
  description: >-
    Retrieve a list of all identifiers (such as DOIs or ARKs) associated with the specified node.

    Identifiers are unique strings that reference the node in external systems. These can include
    persistent identifiers such as DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) or ARKs (Archival Resource Keys).

    #### Response Structure

    The response returns a JSON object containing the following top-level keys:

     - `data`: An array of identifier resources.
     - `links`: Pagination links (if applicable).

    Each item in the `data` array is a distinct identifier object, containing details such as
    the identifier `category` (e.g., `doi`, `ark`), its `value`, and links to the associated node.

    #### Filtering

    You may filter the returned identifiers by category using the `filter[category]` query parameter.

    **Example:**

    Supported filter categories include:
      - `doi` - Digital Object Identifier
      - `ark` - Archival Resource Key

    #### Permissions

     - This endpoint is public for nodes that are public.
     - Authentication is required to access identifiers on private nodes, and the authenticated user must have read access.

  summary: Mint a New Identifier for a Node
  description: >-
    Mint (create) a new identifier for the specified node. 

    Currently, the OSF supports minting **DOI** identifiers through this endpoint.
    Once created, identifiers are permanent and cannot be modified or deleted.

    #### Supported Identifier Categories

     - `doi`: Digital Object Identifier.

    #### Requirements

     - You must have **Admin** or **Write** permissions on the node.
     - The node must be **public** and must **not** be a collection or folder.
     - Only nodes representing individual projects or components are eligible for DOI creation.

    #### Example Request Payload


    ```json

    {
      "data": {
        "type": "identifiers",
        "attributes": {
          "category": "doi"
        }
      }
    }
    
    ```


    #### Permissions
     - Only authenticated users with the required permissions can mint new identifiers.
     - This endpoint is does not authenticate for nodes that are private or not publicly available.

    '400':
      description: >-
        Bad Request. Possible reasons include:
         - The node already has a DOI identifier.
         - The requested identifier category is not supported (only `doi` is allowed).
         - The node is not eligible for DOI creation (e.g., it's a folder or collection).

    '403':
      description: >-
        Forbidden. You do not have permission to create identifiers on this node.
        This may occur if:
         - The node is private.
         - You do not have Admin or Write access to the node.

    '404':
      description: Node not found. Verify the node ID is correct and that you have permission to view the node.
