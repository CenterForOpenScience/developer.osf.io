  summary: List all storage providers
  description: >-
    List of all storage providers that are configured for this node


    Users of the OSF may access their data on a [number of cloud-storage services](https://api.osf.io/v2/#storage-providers) that have integrations with the OSF.
    We call these **providers**. By default, every node has access to the OSF-provided storage but may use as many of
    the supported providers as desired.



    ####Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of files.
    Each resource in the array is a separate file object.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).


    Note: In the OSF filesystem model, providers are treated as folders, but with special properties that distinguish
    them from regular folders. Every provider folder is considered a root folder, and may not be deleted through the regular file API.
