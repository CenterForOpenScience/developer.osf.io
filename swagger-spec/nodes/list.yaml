  summary: List all nodes
  description: >-

    A paginated list of nodes, representing projects and components, on the OSF.


    The returned nodes are those which are public or which the user has access to view.


    The returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated nodes appearing first.


    Registrations cannot be accessed through this endpoint (use the [registrations](#Registrations_registrations_list) endpoints instead).

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 nodes.
    Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the node, meaning additional requests to a node's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).


    This request should never return an error.
    
    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?filter[title]=reproducibility.


    Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.


    Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.
    Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**.
    Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.

  summary: Create a node
  description: >-
    Creates a new node.


    On the OSF, nodes are considered **projects** or **components**.
    The difference between a project and a component is that a project is a top-level node, and a component is a child of a project.


    Additionally, nodes have a `category` field that includes **project** as an option.
    The categorization determines what icon is displayed with the node on the OSF, and helps with search organization.
    Projects (top-level nodes) may have a category other than project, and components (children) may have a category of **project**.

    #### Required

    Required fields for creating a node include:


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`title`


    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`category`


    Note: Nodes default to **private** unless the `public` field is explicitly set to **true** in the request payload.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created node, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
