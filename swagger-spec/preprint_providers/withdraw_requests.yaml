  summary: List Withdraw Requests for a Preprint Provider
  description: >-
    Retrieve a list of withdraw requests for a specific preprint provider.

    These requests require moderation and can be either approved or rejected by provider moderators.

    #### Permissions

    - Unauthorized users will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

    #### Returns
    - A JSON object with a `data` key containing an array of withdraw request resources.
    - Each withdraw request includes the current state, the associated preprint, and relevant timestamps.
