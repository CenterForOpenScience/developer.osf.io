  summary: List all Institutions for a Preprint
  description: >
    A paginated list of the Preprint's Institutions, sorted by their index.

    Institutions are organizations affiliated with the Preprint. Contributors may be associated with one or more institutions.

    Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of Institutions, the institution relationship will not be exposed and the Institution ID will be an empty string.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

    The `data` key contains an array of institutions.
    Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the institution, meaning additional requests to an institution's detail view are not necessary.
    Additionally, the full representation of the institution is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.

    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include institutions that match your filters by utilizing the
    `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9jdt/institutions/?filter[name]=example.
