  summary: List all Contributors for a Preprint
  description: >-
    A paginated list of the Preprint's Contributors, sorted by their index.


    Contributors are users who can make changes to the Preprint.


    Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic".
    From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are
    listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.


    Note that if an anonymous view_only key is being used to view the list of contributors, the user relationship will
    not be exposed and the contributor ID will be an empty string.


    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 contributors.
    Each resource in the array contains the full representation of the contributor, meaning additional requests to a contributor's detail view are not necessary.
    Additionally, the full representation of the user this contributor represents is automatically embedded within the `data` key of the response.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include contributors that match your filters by utilizing the
    `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y9jdt/contributors/?filter[bibliographic]=true.


    Contributors may be filtered by their `bibliographic` and `permission` attributes.

  summary: Create a Contributor
  description: >-
    Adds a contributor to a Preprint, effectively creating a relationship between the Preprint and a user.


    Contributors are users who can make changes to the Preprint.


    Contributors are categorized as either "bibliographic" or "non-bibliographic" contributors.
    From a permissions standpoint, both are the same, but bibliographic contributors are included in citations and are
    listed on the project overview page on the OSF, while non-bibliographic contributors are not.

    #### Permissions

    Only project administrators can add contributors to a Preprint.

    #### Required

    A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the `users` type and valid user ID is required.


    All attributes describing the relationship between the Preprint and the user are optional.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the new contributor, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
