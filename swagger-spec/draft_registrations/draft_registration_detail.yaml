  summary: Retrieve a Draft Registration
  description: >-
    Retrieve the details of a given Draft Registration

    Draft Registrations contain Registration questions that will become part of the Registration.
    A Registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be deleted, but can be withdrawn and have it's metadata edited.


    If you based your Draft Registration on a Project, your original Project remains editable but will now have
    the Draft Registration linked to it.

    #### Permissions

    Only draft registration contributors may view draft registrations.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested
    draft registration, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned.
    Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
