patch:
  summary: Update a user
  description: >-
    Updates a user by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body.
    Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.


    Users can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request.
    The `full_name` field is mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.


    **Note**: if you make a PUT/PATCH request to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user ID in the ID field of the request.
    We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated
    node, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.
