  summary: Retrieve a user
  description: >-
    Retrieves the details for a given user.


    The returned information includes the user's bibliographic information and the date the user was registered.


    Additionally, relationships to the list of institutions with which the user is affiliated,
    and to the list of nodes which the user contributes to (that the requesting user has permission to see) are returned.


    If `me` is given as the `user_id` in the request path, the record of the currently logged-in user will be returned.


    #### Returns


    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested
    user, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.

patch:
  summary: Update a user
  description: >-
    Updates a user by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body.
    Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.


    Users can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request.
    The `full_name` field is mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.


    **Note**: if you make a PUT/PATCH request to the `/users/me/` endpoint, you must still provide your full user ID in the ID field of the request.
    We do not support using the `me` alias in request bodies at this time.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated
    node, if the request is successful.


    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.
