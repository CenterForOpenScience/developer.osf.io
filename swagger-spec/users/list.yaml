get:
  summary: List all users
  description: >-

    A paginated list of all users registered on the OSF.
    The returned users are sorted by their `date_registered`, with the most recently registered users appearing first.


    The subroute `/users/me/` is a special endpoint that always points to the currently logged-in user.

    #### Versioning

    As of version `2.3`, merged users will not be returned from this endpoint.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 users.
    Each resource in the array is a separate users object and contains the full representation of the user, meaning additional requests to a user's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used
    for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).


    This request should never return an error.

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/users/?filter[family_name]=Nosek.


    Users may be filtered by their `id`, `full_name`, `given_name`, `middle_name`, or `family_name`.
