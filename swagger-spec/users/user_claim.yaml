  summary: Claim a User Account
  description: >-
    Allows a user to claim an unregistered OSF account.

    This endpoint is typically used when a contributor is added to a project with an unregistered account,
    and the user wants to claim that account.

    The user can be claimed by either:
     - A logged-in user (who is not the referrer of the unclaimed account).
     - A user who provides an email address for the claim.

    #### Returns

    Returns a `204 No Content` response on successful claim initiation.

    #### Errors

    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing
    information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#tag/Errors-and-Error-Codes)
    to understand why this request may have failed.

    Some common error cases:
     - `403 Forbidden`: The user is not authorized to claim this account.
     - `404 Not Found`: The specified user or record does not exist.
     - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid claim request parameters.
