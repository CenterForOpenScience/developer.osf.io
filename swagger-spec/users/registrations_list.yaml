get:
  summary: List all registrations
  description: >-
    A paginated list of registrations that the user is a contributor to.
    The returned registrations are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated registrations appearing first.


    If the user ID in the path is the same as the logged-in user, all registrations will be returned.
    Otherwise, only the user's public registrations will be returned.


    User nodes are not available at this endpoint.

    #### Returns

    Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.


    The `data` key contains an array of 10 registrations.
    Each resource in the array is a separate registration object and contains the full representation of the registration, meaning additional requests to a registration's detail view are not necessary.


    The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used
    for [pagination](#tag/Pagination).

    #### Filtering

    You can optionally request that the response only include registrations that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g.
    https://api.osf.io/v2/users/cdi38/registrations/?filter[title]=replication.


    Registrations may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, and `contributors`.
