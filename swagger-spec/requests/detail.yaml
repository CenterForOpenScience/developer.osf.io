  summary: Retrieve details for a specific request
  description: >
    Retrieve a specific request by ID. Requests can be associated with either a node or a preprint. 
    Depending on the type, this will return a `node-request` or a `preprint-request` resource.

    A request is a formal submission for actions like access to private content, withdrawal of a preprint, 
    or institutional affiliation. This endpoint returns details about the request's status, creator, type, and comments.

    Permissions:
    - Node requests: Viewable by the node's administrators and the request creator.
    - Preprint requests: Viewable by preprint admins, moderators (for moderated providers), and the request creator.
