  description: >-
    Retrieve a list of requests associated with a specific registration.

    Registration Requests represent user-initiated requests that may include withdrawal requests or requests for changes.
    These requests are typically part of moderated workflows and require approval or rejection by moderators or contributors.

    #### Permissions
    - Public registrations: No authentication required to view public requests.
    - Private registrations: Only contributors with read access may view registration requests.
    - Moderators of the registration provider may view all requests, including pending ones.

    #### Returns
    - A JSON object with a `data` key containing an array of registration request resources.
    - Each request describes the request type, status, creator, and any related comments.
